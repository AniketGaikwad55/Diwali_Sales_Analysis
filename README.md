# 🪔 Diwali Sale Analysis using Pandas

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a Diwali festival campaign using **Python** and the **Pandas** library. The objective is to explore customer purchase behavior, identify top-performing products and demographics, and derive actionable insights to improve future festive sales strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze purchase patterns during the Diwali sale  
- Identify high-performing product categories and customer segments  
- Understand the impact of gender, age, and occupation on sales  
- Provide business insights using exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – Development environment  

## 📁 Dataset Overview

Key columns in the dataset:

- User ID  
- Gender  
- Age Group  
- Marital Status  
- Occupation  
- Product Category  
- Purchase Amount  
- City  

(*Note: Data was cleaned and anonymized for analysis purposes.*)

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed null values and duplicates  
   - Formatted data types (e.g., integers, categories)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed gender-wise and age-wise purchase behavior  
   - Identified top product categories by sales  
   - Analyzed purchase trends by city and occupation  
   - Created visual plots for trend understanding  

3. **Insights Extracted**  
   - Male customers made more purchases during the sale  
   - Age group 26–35 had the highest spending  
   - Category 1 and 2 products were most popular  
   - Tier 1 cities contributed the highest revenue  

## 📈 Sample Visuals

- Bar plot: Purchases by gender  
- Pie chart: Spending by age group  
- Line plot: Sales trend by city  
- Heatmap: Occupation vs. purchase amount  

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Diwali sales data can be analyzed using Pandas to uncover valuable business insights. These findings can help improve marketing strategies, product placement, and customer targeting in future campaigns.
